# Option Pricing

This project is focused on graphing the binomial or trinomial trees. 
And also the derivation of the prices for exotic options.

- Forward Start - A forward on an option except that the premium is paid today
- Compound - An option on an option
- Chooser - Investor can choose whether the option will become a call or a put by a specified choice date
- Barrier - 4 combinations â€“ Up & Out, Down & Out, Up & In, Down & In
- Binary - Pays a predetermined amount or nothing
- Rainbow - Payoff depends on the best or the worst of the two or more risky assets
- Swaption - An option giving the right to enter into an underlying swap agreement
